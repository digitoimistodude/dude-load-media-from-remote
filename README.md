# Load images from remote for Dudestack

A WordPress plugin that tries to load images from remote url if file is not present in local environment.

## Usage

Define the remote url in `REMOTE_MEDIA_URL` environment variable.

## Disclaimer

This plugin is made to use with Dudestack and Air Helper, but it might work without it too, since it only alters the url. Notice that the url structure and image sizes must be exactly the same in the remote env.
